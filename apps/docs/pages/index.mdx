# Introduction

Piksel UI is a starter kit for creating your own component systems with React. It is a collection of beautiful, production-ready user interface components that you leave to your projects, as well as your own code, for you to customize, adapt, and make your own.

## Before you start

Make sure you have a Tailwind CSS project set up that you want to use with Piksel UI before you do anything else. Piksel UI is built with React, but it is not tied to any specific React framework and can be used in any React project, including Next.js, Remix, Inertia, or any other React project.
