You can install Piksel UI to your project using one of the following package managers.

<Tabs id="language" items={['npm', 'yarn', "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  
```bash
npm install @piksel-ui/react-core @piksel-ui/react-hooks
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  
```bash
yarn add @piksel-ui/react-core @piksel-ui/react-hooks
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  
```bash
pnpm add @piksel-ui/react-core @piksel-ui/react-hooks
```

  </Tab>

In order to use Piksel UI components, you need to install these packages which contain some helper functions, types and hooks. After that, you can go to the page of the component you want to use and copy the source code to your project.
